No Risk Planning - Instalation Guide
--------------------------------------------------------------

0. Requirements:

No Risk Planning is a web based group calendar, developed
using PHP and MySQL.

To install it, you will need to have a web server (like Apache)
with PHP, and a MySQL server.

To process XSLT server side, you will need to compile your PHP
with -enable-xslt. To do so, you have to include the 
parameter --enable-xslt in your configure command line, like:

configure --enable-xslt

If you want to use the automatic generation of the .png image
of the schedule, you will have to compile your PHP with
--without-gd, like:

configure --without-gd

-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Instalation Process

After you have installed all the required features in your
computer, do the following:

a) Uncompress the source files in your desired directory.

b) Create a user and a database in your MySQL to be used by 
No Risk Planning.

c) Set the configurations of your No Risk Planning in the file
inc/config.inc.php
This file contains all the configurations of your schedule.
Pay attention at the database configuration, at the
appointment types, and the schedule periodicity.

d) Set the writing permissions to the directories docs and
smarty/template_c, using 'chmod 707 docs' and
'chmod 707 smarty/template_c'.

e) Create an account at MySQL and a database to be used by 
No Risk Planning.
This can be done using the commands:
1) CREATE DATABASE database_name;
2) GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO user@server IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
3) FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

* Usually server is localhost

f) Initialize the database using the command:
'mysql -u user -p < nrp.sql'

After you have installed No Risk Planning, 
you may add new users in the Administrator mode.
To enter the Administrator mode, open the system,
and use the id 'admin'. The first password for this
user will be set as 'noriskadmin', and you may change
it as soon as you want to.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Note: If you have a previous version of No Risk Planning,
open the file 'old_nrp_conversion.php', located in the /inc directory
, set the configurations
of the old database, and use the 
command 'php old_nrp_conversion.php' in order to transfer 
the data to the new database.
